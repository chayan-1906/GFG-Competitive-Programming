## What is CP (Competitive Programming)? 
```
Competitive programming is a sport. 
A sport based on problem-solving skills, thinking ability, speed testing, regularity and to be precise. 
Competitive Programming will help you build logic and implement that logic to find solutions to a real-world problem. 
Brainstorming upon your code will increase your coding skills as well as it will help to expand your thinking capacity.
